# Music-Generator
AI Music Generator is a deep learning project that creates original music in the form of MIDI files based on two user-selected inputs: genre and emotion. Built using a lightweight LSTM-based neural network, the model is trained on a subset of the XMIDI dataset and generates melodies by predicting musical note sequences.
